			I am XXXXX, 
			a college student majoring in Criminology.
			For all my life, 
			I have dreamed that I could become a detective.
			My idol Mr. XXXX owns the greatest detective agent in the U.S.,
			and under his eyes, every case has a moment of truth.
			I got to know him when he once gave a talk in my high school.
			But it was two months ago, 
			when I accidentally helped his team detect a stolen exhibit case 
			that he started to appreciate my ability.
			From then on, 
			I always dreamed that I could work with his team sometime.
			That's the coolest thing that I could ever imagine.

			Why am I feeling so dizzy... 
			I must be very drunk last night...
			I need to go out and get a cup of water.
			It seems that the lock is broken...
			Hey, is anybody out there? 
			Umm...It is only seven o'clock.
			They are probably still asleep.
			Wait...
